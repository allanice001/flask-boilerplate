This is some Flask boilerplate that I always pull together when starting a new application. Helps getting up and running a lot faster.

A lot of this is inspired form the Flask Megatutorial by Miguel Grinberg located [here](http://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world). Miguel's tutorial is amazing and the model he lays out for development can't be beat in my opinion. Thanks Miguel.
